# Changelog

What changed in each release of UE MM, newest first: one short line per change.
The app shows this list (the **Changelog** link in the sidebar's update box), so
every release adds its section at the top, as `## <version> (<yyyy-mm-dd>)`.

## 2.3 (2026-11-12)
- Fixed: when the .NET runtime on the PC was damaged, the app closed at once without a word. It now says so and offers to download Microsoft's repair

## 2.2 (2026-11-12)
- Mods you downloaded but did not install stay after a restart. They show on the Mods page: click Install to add one, or Delete if you no longer want it
- Fixed: after the PC was turned off and on again, the app sometimes did not open and said it "does not answer"
- Clicking the app several times while it opens no longer says it "does not answer"; the open window shows instead
- Opened straight from a zip or rar file, the app asks you to extract it first, or it stops opening after a restart

## 2.1 (2026-11-12)
- The Mods page shows each mod as a card with its picture and summary from Nexus, as the Browse page does; switch between Preview and Compact above the list
- Mods from Nexus are named in your language; an installed mod whose name is still the site's English name takes it too, and a name you chose stays
- The changelog opens by itself on first use and after each update, with a button to donate any amount on afdian; tick "Do not show again" to turn it off

## 2.0 (2026-11-11)
- New Browse mods page: browse, search and sort this game's Nexus mods, preview a mod and install it with one click; adult mods are never shown
- Mod names, summaries, descriptions and changelogs from Nexus are translated with a free online translator; switch back to the original text at any time
- Simpler layout: the mod loader offers and warnings moved to the new Loaders page, and the Mods and Home pages show less
- Donate to the author: a button in the sidebar and on the About page opens the afdian page of the author of this modified version

## 1.6.1.2 (2026-11-08)
- A file of the same name that the manager did not install, such as a mod copied in by hand, no longer stops an install or update: it moves to the backups first
- A download is kept until its mod is in: after a cancelled install window or a failed install, Update installs it without a new download

## 1.6.1.1 (2026-11-08)
- Modified version of UE MM 1.6.1 by KintaroModding and contributors, with a name of its own: 影之刃模组管理器
- Import a mod by pasting its Nexus Mods link
- Installed Nexus mods are checked for updates at start; update one mod or all of them with one click, and each keeps its name
- Nexus Mods API key in Settings; free accounts download with Mod Manager Download or Slow download on the mod page, which hands the file to the manager
- Downloads run in the background, with their progress at the bottom right; a finished download installs by itself and its file is then deleted
- The install window opens only when there is something to choose
- A missing Mods Menu or PBZModLoader gets a button to install it, right below the error
- No Donate or Discord buttons; app updates come from this version's own releases on GitHub

## 1.6.1 (2026-11-07)
- Open mod page in each mod's row and details, for a mod whose download kept the mod site's file name; the app reads the mod's number from that name, with no network
- Mods installed with an older version get the link too; other mods show "No mod page", and the mods on the card show neither
- A second download of the same file, whose name ends in (1), now also gets its name and version
- Not possible yet: a real update check. It needs access to the mod site's API, which still waits for approval, so Open mod page is the most the app can do for now

## 1.6.0 (2026-11-07)
- Mods Menu and PBZModLoader can be installed together: Mods Menu 0.9.0 and PBZModLoader 2.1.0 or newer run side by side
- A warning when a known older version of either would cause problems, and PBZModLoader's hid entry stays out beside Mods Menu
- Show files lists the files in the mods folder that the manager did not install
- The UE4SS window shows its note on which release to take only for a download by hand

## 1.5.9 (2026-11-07)
- Filter the mod list by All, Enabled or Disabled; Enabled hides the disabled mods
- Sort the list by Status, Type and Integrity too, not only by name and date
- Tag suggestions under the Tags field: your own tags and common ones, narrowed as you type; Tab completes

## 1.5.8 (2026-11-07)
- Same file names as an installed mod: the install window asks whether to update it or keep both
- Keep both puts the new mod in a folder of its own in ~mods, with a note that only one style may show
- Donate button above the Discord button: fully optional, and its X removes it for good (the About page keeps it)

## 1.5.7 (2026-11-06)
- Tags for your mods: add them at install or with the Add tag button, then filter the list with one click
- An X in the search boxes clears the text, and so does Esc
- Mods with loose files below the game's project folder install whole, such as the images of Quest Navigation
- Mods for PBZModLoader also install from a zip without the ProjectPBZ folder on top
- A .sig file goes with its pak, and a file such as license.json or notice.ini is no longer taken for a document
- The install window warns when a file stays out that the mod may need
- The install window warns about a mod with only a main.ts: PBZModLoader 2.0 cannot use it
- A clearer message when a download has no mod files

## 1.5.6 (2026-11-05)
- PBZModLoader on the recommended card: its own fix for pak mods, no UE4SS needed (thanks, LKF)
- UE4SS C++ BYPASS stays on the card as an extra download
- Upgrade from a PBZModLoader installed by hand: old files go to a backup, mods and settings stay
- Mods for PBZModLoader install, and a zip with a copy for two loaders installs only one copy
- A script mod waits until its loader is installed
- Mods Menu and PBZModLoader: only one of them at a time
- A mod that only shares a file with another mod no longer replaces it
- Scripts named like install.js or notice.js are no longer left out
- No more note before installing Game files or Exe files mods

## 1.5.3 (2026-11-04)
